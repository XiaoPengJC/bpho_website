        <h2>Task One</h2>
        <p>Using Solar System parameters, verify that the square of orbital period is proportional to the cube 
            of the orbital semi-major axis. If units of years for time and Astronomical Units (AU) for distance are used, 
            show that the constant of proportionality is very
            close to unity for the Solar System.</p>

    <div class = "card" onclick = "location.href = 'task-two/'">
        <h2>Task Two</h2>
        <p>Compute and accurately plot elliptical orbits of the five inner planets. 
            Then (using a larger scale), plot the outer planet orbits.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "card" onclick = "location.href = 'task-three/'">
        <h2>Task Three</h2>
        <p>Create a 2D animation of the orbits of the planets.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "card" onclick = "location.href = 'task-four/'">
        <h2>Task Four</h2>
        <p>Use the inclination angle value ÔÅ¢ and hence plot 3D orbit animations of the planets. 
            Do include the dwarf planet Pluto, as it is off the plane of the ecliptic much more than the other planets.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "card" onclick = "location.href = 'task-five/'">
        <h2>Task Five</h2>
        <p>Use Simpson's numeric integration method to determine how orbital time varies with polar angle. 
            Hence code-up a function which outputs orbit polar angle from orbit time. Update your models with this function, 
            and contrast how polar angle varies with time for Pluto, compared to a circular motion example with the same 248.348 
            year period.</p>

    <div class = "card" onclick = "location.href = 'task-six/'">
        <h2>Task Six</h2>
        <p>Choose a pair of planets and determine their orbits vs
            time. At fixed time intervals, draw a line between the planets and plot their positions. 
            Keep going for 10 orbits of the outermost planet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "card" onclick = "location.href = 'task-seven/'">
        <h2>Task Seven</h2>
        <p>Use your orbital models to plot the orbits of the other bodies in the solar system, with a chosen object 
            (e.g. Earth) at a fixed position at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. i.e. choose a coordinate system 
            where your chosen object is at (0,0,0).</p>
